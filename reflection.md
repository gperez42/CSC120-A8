- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

My class represents a magical zoo where the user can cause magical animals to be born. The Animal class allows new animal species to be created when they're born. These animals can grab, drop, examine, and use items. Some of them can also walk and fly if they have those abilities. Additionally, the user has the power to imaginatively remove an animal from their zoo, even though that magical animal's fairy dust will always remain.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I didn't end up implementing any additional methods that weren't in the interface.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that trying to make a minimum viable product first really helped me get started, rather than trying to implement all of the additional features that I wanted. Additionally, what didn't work for me was trying to implement more methods on my own without any support at the last minute, it didn't work out and I just wasted a bunch of time. Starting early is super important and I definitely feel a difference whenever I am able to and whenever I'm not able to, I wish I can taken a little more time to play around with my code and I would recommend that to any future CSC 120 students.
